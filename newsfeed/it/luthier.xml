            8349 people joined this year's race against the clock to make the perfect stringed instrument in 1 week, working on their instrument 5 hours a day.<br/>
            There are prizes to win for the categories: Violin, Guitar, Cello, Viola and Bass guitar.<br/><br/>
            DaVinci University’s students also joined this year for the first time. DaVinci University offers different courses on building instruments.<br/><br/>
            This year our very own Neka Albin won the first prize in the violin category.<br/>
            “I had been learning to make all different kind of instruments, but the making of a violin spoke to me the most so I signed up for that category. At DaVinci University I learned all the techniques I used during this competition. I didn’t think someone who only learned luthing 2 years ago was able to win.”<br/><br/>
            We as a school are very proud at all our students that attended the competition. Once school starts we will evaluate their instruments and work on them even more, to make the perfect instrument.
