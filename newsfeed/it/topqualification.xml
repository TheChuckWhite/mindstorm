           In 2017 DaVinci University received the top qualification in the HBO Selection Guide. The themes: teachers, preparation career care, guidance and testing among other things made this qualification possible.<br/><br/>
           DaVinci University Executive Board:<br/>
           “Together with all the teachers and students we made sure this could happen. We will of course not stop with making the university even better. We are now focusing more on international education and strive to make the university a university for everyone. No matter where you are in the world you should be able to get education of a high quality.”<br/><br/>
           Students of DaVinci University:<br/>
           “At school I feel listened too, they take my input serious and really want to help you.”<br/>
           “At first I wasn’t really sure about the way they teach, but after a while I got used to it and it learned me to take initiative.”<br/>
           “I really think they made me valuable for a company. The way they teached was to prepare us for life after school. I think it works since during my internship I got offered a job.”<br/>
